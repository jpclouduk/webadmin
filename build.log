✔ Client: Compiled successfully in 33.73s
[ERROR] Docusaurus server-side rendering could not render static page with path /date.
[INFO] It looks like you are using code that should run on the client-side only.
To get around it, try using `<BrowserOnly>` (https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus-core/#browseronly) or `ExecutionEnvironment` (https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus-core/#executionenvironment).
It might also require to wrap your client code in `useEffect` hook and/or import a third-party library dynamically (if any).
✔ Server: Compiled with some errors in 1.34m
